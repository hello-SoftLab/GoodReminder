# GoodReminder

> GoodReminder is a project made for people who suffer from anxiety and from low self-worth;

## ðŸ“™ How the idea came to life;

GoodReminder first came to be as a project after [Ingrid](https://github.com/ingavell) complained about always forgetting small daily victories.

Those were crucial as they reminded her of not pushing herself so hard.

She decided to try a journal, one practical enough to carry all the time, but also one that didn't show her today's entries so it couldn't allow making comparisons of prior days.

## ðŸ’» Action time;

The ideia went to [OtÃ¡vio](https://github.com/knz13) and he suggested to make an app which would allow daily entries and also have the constraints showed before.

The UI and flowcharts were discussed between *hello;* members. OtÃ¡vio made sure to study and test android platforms ~yes she uses android~ so the app could run smoothly.

All of the info below has its own folder in this repository, don't forget to check it out!
